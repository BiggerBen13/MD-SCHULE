## Feelings

If I had to leave Germany, I would be a bit nervous and sad because I'd have to leave my friends but I'd also look forward to moving to the US because I like the school system there. The most difficult thing would be to find new friends. I think it would be most exciting to go to school and meet new people.
In the past travelling to the country where you wanted to start your new life was harder than today. It took days or weeks to get to the country and it was dangerous. Today travelling is faster and safer. It's the same that you're always a bit excited when you start a new life in another country because you leave everything behind you and you don't know what will happen exactly.
