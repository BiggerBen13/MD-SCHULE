# The Cherokee

The Cherokee are the biggest indigene clan that still exists.
They are thought to be a split of the Mohawks. Their first encounter with the west man, was in 1540.
Because they didn't know much about the  they were, and they were a peaceful Pack, they let the Western man roam on their land.
That sadly ended in a tragedy, in which many Cherokee were slaughtered, enslaved or banned from their own land.
    After some time, they had figured out a trading arrangement, in which the Cherokee gave animal fur and slaves to the European and the European supplied them with guns and animals.

After 1721 The Cherokee made more trading arrangements with Alabama, France, England and Charlestown.
The connection between the Cherokee and England got stronger over the years, to the point where they even fought alongside them in wars

The first President of the United States of America promised the Cherokee education an other support, and they got integrated into the society.
