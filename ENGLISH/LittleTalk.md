## P.85 Ex. 8b

In the timespan from 1880 and 1930, a lot of people immigrated to the USA, in fact in total 20.1million people, the biggest part of those people where form italy, the actually smallest immigration numbers come from Sweden. but it seems like most of the people came from Europe, a really small part also came from Ireland, but what suprised me, that Britains actually immigrated to the USA, after all that war, that happend between the USA and Great Britain, but I guess, that is a thing of the past,
in conclusion, you can say, that a lot of Europian people wanted to move to the Usa.

The Table, which came from the Ellis Island Foundation

Italy : Majority of people, just sligtly above the Austro-Hungarian-Empire
sligtly after the third italian War of independence was ended and the aftermath.

most people probably came from Countrys where english wasnt the first language, I think the biggest part of them moved before the first world war

Sweden : Minority of people
Pretty much all of the immigrated people come form Europe, not asia or the Antarctica
Great Britain : Even tho there were big conflicts
