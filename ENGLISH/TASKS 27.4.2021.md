## KV 43 Working with Langauge

### Nr.1
I came to the US in 1923. at first I missed my old home terribly, but I never thought of returning. My first Hob was working in the house of a rich family.
They didn't treat me very well, so after a few months I left and started working for another family. They were very nice to me and never said anything cruel about my bad English ÷ the opposite of the first family. I learned English quickly and I started writing about my impressions of my new home. People thought they were interesting and after a while I started selling articles to a national newspaper. I was earning amazingly good  money! America really was a land of new possibilities for me
